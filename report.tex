\section{Problem Definition}
In this assignment, you are required to implement and benchmark community search
algorithm using clustering.
The algorithms should first compute user similarity by
vertex similarity and personal page-rank
and should perform a K-means clustering.

\section{Design and Implementation}
The algorithm has three steps. First, we compute the similarity matrix
by vertex similarity or personalized PageRank. Then, we perform
a K-Means algorithm with this similarity matrix. Then, we compare
the K-Means results.

We compare the result with three models: Purity, Entropy
and Normalized mutual information (NMI).

If $W = {w_1, w_2, ..., w_k}$ is the set of clusters and
$C = {c_1, c_2, ..., c_j}$ is the set classes. Then,

\begin{align}
  purity(W, C) = \dfrac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{k}\max_j{w_j \bigcap c_j}
\end{align}.
a perfect clustering has a purity of 1.

For entropy,

\begin{align}
  H(W) = -\sum\limits_kP(w_k)logP(w_k) = -\sum\limits_k\dfrac{|w_k|}{N}log\dfrac{|w_k|}{N}
\end{align}

The minimum of $H(W)$ is 0 if the clustering is random with respect to class
membership. In that case, knowing that a document
is in a particular cluster does not give us any new information
about what its class might be.

For NMI, it is always a value between 0 to 1.


\subsection{Design and Implementation}
We implemented the algorithm using python. We implemented
the personalized PageRank ourselves and use KMeans implementation
from sklearn.


\subsection{Benchmark}
Evaluation of the algorithm is focused of Purity, Entropy and NMI
of using different similarity matrix and size of clusters.
Table~\ref{result} shows the result. Purity-S means the purity of
using vertex similarity, while Purity-PR means the purity of using
personalized PageRank.
